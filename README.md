## Volumetric Display using Rotating Mirror
An idea of Volumetric Display by changing the optical path with two spinning mirrors
The location of the rotating 45° mirror is fixed. The vertical mirror is doing the circular motion, always facing the 45° mirror with the same angular velocity.
So the optical path from screen to eye is periodically changed.
