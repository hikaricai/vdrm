## Volumetric Display using Rotating Mirror(early stage)
An idea of Volumetric Display by changing the optical path with two spinning mirrors

The location of the rotating 45° mirror 10 is fixed. The vertical mirror 9(can also be replaced with a led screen) is doing the circular motion, always facing the 45° mirror with the same angular velocity. When watching from the top, the optical path from transparent screen 11 to eye is periodically changed.
